          eMi is an AI-powered learning companion created for preschools. Running on a dedicated
          tablet with no distractions, it offers personalized games that nurture skills in math,
          language, and emotional growth. Each child has their own avatar, making it easy to pick up
          where they left off, while teachers can track progress, nudge incomplete tasks, and gain
          clear insights into every childâ€™s development. eMi works seamlessly offline and syncs data
          when online, ensuring learning never stops.
